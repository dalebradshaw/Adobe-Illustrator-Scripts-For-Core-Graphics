A small collection of Adobe Illustrator Scripts to work with Quartz2D-Core Graphics.

Move the script of interest to Presets/Scripts in the application folder.

Note: Move the rulers origin point to lower left to match Core Graphics. Adobe changed the default origin point in AI CS5+ to be negative from upper
left. To use this script in AI CS5+, choose View->Rulers->Change To Global Rulers and move the ruler origin point to lower left.

db_ExportPathAsCoreGraphicsPath.jsx - Select an Illustrator path, run the
script and output Core Graphics .h and .m file
